# CraftOS 1.3 BetterShell Project

Porting of most newer CraftOS func. and some linux niceties to CraftOS 1.3 
(the one shipped with... Tekkit Classic... _yeah the one with Minecraft 1.2.5_)

#### Why would you do such a thing?

_Funy_

Jokes aside, it is just a self declared challenge. I want to port things like better keyboard navigation and bash-completeion-like autocomplete (and perhaps a simple vi editor?). If anything, it will get me experience.

## What to do

I didn't even start yet.
But check [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for a checklist (if i make one)

  Also the guy is nuts, madlad patched most of the dupes/vulns that normal servers just disable the items causing them and still updates the infra and the mods every now and then.
